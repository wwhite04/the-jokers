<h1>Meet the players</h1>
<div style="clear: left;" id="callum" class="border">
  <p style="float: left;" style="font-size:20px;">CALLUM PEMBERTON <br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/callum.pemberton3_/"><img src="images/players/callum_photo.jpeg" alt="photo_calllum" width="200" height="200" ></a></p>
  <p style="font-size:27px;">Callum's ability to create his shot, make quick decisions, and read the defense can make or break his team's success. Opponents will focus their defensive efforts on shutting him down, which will require him to adjust his game and find ways to get his teammates involved. However, Callum's talent and determination make him a valuable asset to his team, and his success can often be the determining factor in securing a victory</p><br>
</div>
<div style="clear: left;" id="witte" class="border">
  <p style="float: left;" style="font-size:20px;">JACOB WITTE <br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacob.witte_/"><img src="images/players/witte_photo.jpeg" alt="photo_witte" width="200" height="200" ></a></p>

He has a deadly accurate shot from beyond the arc, which makes him a key player in the team's offensive strategy.

This opens up opportunities for his teammates to drive to the basket or make passes to other players who may be in better positions to score. Ryan's skill set as a 3-point specialist makes him a valuable member of his team and a player that opponents always have to keep an eye on.</p>

Defensively, his size and wingspan make it difficult for opponents to score near the rim. Daniel's skill set and physical attributes make him a crucial player in his team's success and a player that opponents have to game plan around.</p><br>
</div>
<div style="clear: left;" id="jamie" class="border">
  <p style="float: left;" style="font-size:20px;">JAMIE PETERS <br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamiep_15/"><img src="images/players/jamie_photo.jpeg" alt="photo_jamie" width="200" height="300" ></a></p>
